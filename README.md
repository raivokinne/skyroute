## Features

- **Real-Time Drone Tracking:** Monitor drone locations and statuses in real-time.
- **Go API Backend:** The core API is developed in Go for high performance and concurrency.
- **React Frontend:** An interactive and responsive user interface built with React.
- **Microservices Architecture:**
  - Services implemented using both Python and Golang to handle business logic.
  - Asynchronous communication and integration via Kafka and RabbitMQ.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Fully containerized with Docker to simplify deployment and scaling.
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns between the API, frontend, and service layers.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Docker (v20+ recommended)
    Docker Compose
    Git

Setup

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-delivery-management-system.git
cd drone-delivery-management-system

Build and Run with Docker:

The project includes Docker configurations for all components, including the Go API, React frontend, Python/Golang services, Kafka, and RabbitMQ:

docker-compose up --build

This command builds the Docker images and starts all the services.

Manual Setup:

Alternatively, you can set up each component individually:

    API (Go):

cd src/api
# Install dependencies and run the Go server (assuming Go modules are used)
go run main.go

Frontend (React):

cd src/frontend
npm install
npm start

Services:

    Python Service:

cd src/services/python_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Golang Service:

            cd src/services/golang_service
            go run main.go

Usage

Once the services are running, you can access the application components:

    Frontend: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your Docker configuration).
    API: The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000 (or as defined in your configuration).
    Messaging Services: Kafka and RabbitMQ will be running as defined in the Docker setup for handling asynchronous communications between services.

Common Commands

    Start All Services:

docker-compose up

Stop All Services:

docker-compose down

View Logs:

    docker-compose logs -f

Development
Code Overview

    API (Go): Implements RESTful endpoints and core business logic.
    Frontend (React): Provides the user interface for interacting with the system.
    Services (Python & Golang): Handle specialized tasks and background processing.
    Messaging: Kafka and RabbitMQ are used to facilitate communication between microservices.

Running Locally

For development, you can work on individual components as follows:

    Go API:

cd src/api
go run main.go

React Frontend:

cd src/frontend
npm install
npm start

Python Service:

cd src/services/python_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Golang Service:

    cd src/services/golang_service
    go run main.go

Testing

Test scripts are provided in the scripts/ directory. To run tests:

./scripts/run_tests.sh

Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured as needed.
